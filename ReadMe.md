# Application Development and Security (APDS7311)

This repository is my final POE submission for the module, it contains the code from part 2 and part 3.

Part 2 was the backend Node.JS, this includes the routing, models, middleware, auth and MongoDB database interactions. Part 3 was the frontend Angular, this included the input validation, user interface, and services to interact with the backend.

**Important Note:** If you with to run this code you will need to add a MongoDB URl to the .env file in the backend folder.

## Application Framework

This web application was made using Node.JS and Angular. It intergrated with MongoDB to save the data and the users.

## About the applicaiton

This web application was made for a collage course called Application Development and Security (APDS7311), the main goal was to make a goverment bullitin board that allowed employees to create posts about any topic. There needed to be authentication and authorisation for user control, verfification for inpouts, error handeling, certificate creation and database interactions. 

This application is the fisrt one I ever used Node.JS or Angular in.
